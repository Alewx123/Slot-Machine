# Slot-Machine

This Git repository contains a Python program for a prime state slot machine. 
Players can deposit an imaginary sum and place bets on lines. 
Betting on one line counts the first row, while betting on two lines counts the first and second rows. 
Similarly, betting on three lines includes all three rows for consideration.
